## Class-04 Reading Notes  
<p>It is pretty self-evident that readings on HTML, CSS and JavaScript have relevance to the course at hand -- they're the building blocks of modern websites.</p>

### Learn HTML - Creating Hyperlinks

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
    * Anchor tags
2. The href attribute contains what information?
    * Web address
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
    * Adding a title
    * Include link text with key words so search engines can more easily index files
    * Visual readers prefer link text since they skim over pages, and the text makes it easier for them to select links of interest
    * Screen readers jump around to different links on a page fairly randomly, so try to organize in such a way to counter that


### CSS Layout - Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
    * The way elements lay out on a web page if no CSS has been applied
2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
    * Inline elements don't force a new line to begin in the document flow, whereas block-level elements cause a new line to occur
    * A block-level element takes up the full width available, while an inline element only takes up as much width as necessary
3. <u>Static</u> positioning is the default for every html element.

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
    * Can create UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements, like popup boxes, control menus, rollover panels and others
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
    * Fixed positiong fixes an element relative to the visible portion of the viewport, whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor 


### Learn JS - Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
    * Function declaration is the actual writing of the function.
    * Function invocation is the actual 'calling' of the function; until the function is called/invoked, it is completely useless.
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
    * Not required, but some functions have parameters to be inputted into the parentheses before the function can be invoked, e.g. a 'sum' function may have 2 'number' parameters that must inputted
    * Argument is what is actually inputted into the function that meet the requirements of the parameters -- e.g. from 'sum' function above, the parameters may be (num1, num2), and the arguments could be (3, 5), with the function outputting 8.

### Miscellaneous - 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
    * Job interview readiness: I am aware of the fact that some companies conduct interviews this way, so getting experience under the belt would definitely help.
    * Work environment readiness: similar to the likely related job interview readiness, preparing for the 'real world' makes a lot of sense.

## Things I want to know more about

1. I need a lot more experience working with CSS; seems like a topic that is hard to read about; have to just primarily learn by doing.
2. I obviously will have to learn more about pair programming through practice; I am a total novice in the area.
