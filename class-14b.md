## Class-14b Reading Notes  
<p>The article covers best practices in team building, and clearly this is relevant to the modern work force, especially in the tech space.</p>

### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

### Summary

* The article details Project Aristotle, a research project launched at Google to study team performance, an attempt to isolate the key variables on why certain teams perform better than others
* The team's results were paradoxical, although the author didn't appear to pick up on that seemingly highly relevant fact
    * The team initially discovered 'the who' didn't matter in terms of team performance, but rather a team's norms were the key factor to success, specifically around *psychological safety*, basically a group environment where one can 'just be yourself'
    * But then the research pointed to the fact that the teams that performed well, i.e. that had greater psychological safety (effectively superior norms), were based on the fact that the team members themselves scored above average on the *Reading the Mind in the Eyes* test (a test that measures ‘average social sensitivity’, i.e. being skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues) -- so 'the who' does in fact matter a LOT

### My Take

* I have an MBA so have lived through myriad management books and fads and gurus -- I always go back to a business school professor who was responsible for implementing teams in Chrysler's manufacturing process 
  * He took teams very seriously, and thought there were very few organizations, outside of the military, that took building a culture around team very seriously -- re. military, in the Marines, officers always eat last after their enlisted Marines go first -- that is real culture-building
  * His other great maxim that he applied generally to all manner of paradigm shifts in management thinking -- "you can't get away from the fact that it almost always 'just depends'"
* My point is that for a company to truly go beyond the randomized factor of individual teams depending on 'the who', the company itself has have a culture of a successful team, and that is VERY hard to do, and has to come from complete and total buy-in at the top 
* As ex-military and having worked in big tech firm in the Valley, I was amazed at how bad the basic management skills like 'lead by example' were -- I only ever encountered a culture built upon lies and politics -- good luck building teams in such an environment -- the official teams I was on there were 'air quote teams' -- but on an ad hoc basis, people did find a way to cooperate to get jobs done when their careers were at stake, i.e. heavily incentive-driven

## Things I want to know more about

1. I would be curious about learning more specifically about any nuances that have evolved in best practices for strictly remote teams -- no doubt, people are people, so the premises will apply, but still curious about the topic.
