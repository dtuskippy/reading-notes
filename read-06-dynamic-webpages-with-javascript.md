## Dynamic Webpages with JavaScript Reading Notes

### Defining JavaScript

* Excerpts from [(JavaScript on Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript): 

  * *JavaScript is a high level, often just-in-time compiled programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.*
  * *As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.*
  * *All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.*
  * *JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.* 
  
### Basic JavaScript Overview

* Whereas HTML is used to create the structure and actual content of a web page (such as written text), and CSS is responsible for the design or style of the website, JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements and allows for the development of interactive websites.
* CSS uses *selectors* to select items in html to format, e.g.
  * Universal selector: *
  * Type selector: elementname
  * Class selector: .classname
  * ID selector: #idname
  * Attribute selector: [attr=value]
* The most standard way of coding CSS is to do so 'externally', by using a separate stylesheet with a css extension; the *stylesheet.css* is linked to the relevant HTML file
* Example code to change the background color of a footer via an *element selection* 
  * footer { 
      background-color: red; 
    }

### JavaScript online resource

* Among many, probably the most respected practial online resource for developers is found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) on the MDN (Mozilla Developers Network) website.
