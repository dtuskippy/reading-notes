## Dynamic Webpages with JavaScript Reading Notes

### Defining JavaScript

* Excerpts from [(JavaScript on Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript): 

  * *JavaScript is a high level, often just-in-time compiled programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.*
  * *As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.*
  * *All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.*
  * *JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.* 
  
### JavaScript Highlights

* Whereas HTML is used to create the structure and actual content of a web page (such as written text), and CSS is responsible for the design or style of the website, JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements and allows for the development of interactive websites.
* JavaScript is single threaded. This is the reason lots of people who use multi-threaded programming thinks its working is slow as it would not be able to make use of all the cores of the CPU properly.
* Despite the fact that there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, respective standard libraries and syntax, these two languages are distinct and differ significantly in design.
* Like all other scripting languages, arrays and objects can be created with a brief shortcut syntax. These literals structure the basis of JSON data format.
* JavaScript supports regular expressions in a manner similar to Perl, which provides a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.

### JavaScript online resource

* Among many, probably the most respected practial online resource for developers is found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) on the MDN (Mozilla Developers Network) website.
