## Class-09 Reading Notes  
<p>It is clear that readings on HTML and CSS are relevant to the course on hand -- they're 2 of the 3 (along with JavaScript) building blocks of modern websites.</p>

### HTML Forms

1. Why are forms so important in web development?
    * Web forms are important because they serve as the 'portal' (for lack of a better term) for the most overt form of user interaction with a website, where the user actively enters in information to the site.
2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?
    * Take UI seriously, and start with a mockup.
    * The bigger and more complex the form, the more it is likely to annoy and frustrate users, and that obviously will suppress engagement, which is a bad thing -- so, keep it simple and small.
3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.
    * <form\>: a container element like a footer or section.
    * <input\>: takes in user input; type attribute defines type of input, e.g. text, email address.
    * <label\>: effectively helps gives name to form control, which is helpful with screen readers, general navigation.
    * <textarea\>: multi-line plain-text editing control -- most frequently used for users to post comments, other types of feedback.
    * <button\>: allows the user to click a 'send' button, which then sends their data to the backend server.

### JavaScript - Introduction to Events

1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
    * Events are effectively website sensors, that alert you various activity on your site.
2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
    * Name of the event.
    * Function that handles the event.
3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
    * It's a reference to the element the event took place upon.
4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
    * Bubbling goes inside out, and event capturing goes outside in, e.g. bubbling would button, div, body, whereas capturing would go in opposite order.

## Things I want to know more about

1. Interactivity is a very key area to be on top of, so I want as much hands-on experience in this area as possible.
