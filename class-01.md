## Class-01 Reading Notes  
### Getting Started

1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.
    * HTTP like a bow in the quiver
    * From A to B it's fixing to deliver
    * From north to south and from shore to shore
    * Here's hoping you don't wind up with a 404
2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
    * First, the browser parses the HTML, and as part of the process will recogize link or script elements for CSS and JS respectively
    * It will then request CSS or JS files it has found from the server, and subsequently parse them
    * From the parsed HTML, an in-memory DOM tree is generated; from the parsed CSS, and in-memory CSSOM structure is generated; and parsed JS is compiled and executed
    * Eventually a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen for the user to see and interact with
3. How can you find images to add to a Website?
    * An obvious place to start is with [Google Images](https://images.google.com/) -- care must be taken not to violate copyright, and filtering via usage rights for Creative Commons licenses is a good practice
4. How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
    * Strings are effectively text and enclosed in single or double quotes, as long as the single or double quotes are not mixed
    * Numbers are *just numbers,* and are not enclosed in quotes
5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?
    * Variables are containers that contain values, e.g. let day = Monday;
    * Variables are the key basis that make computer programs dynamic, by allowing values to change

* Excerpts from [(article on choosing a text editor)](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf): 
  *   *A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.*
    + *Some of the most important features are:*
      1. *code completion*
      2. *syntax highlighting*
      3. *a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)*
      4. *the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them*



### CLI (Command Line Interface) defined -- [(CLI in Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
* *A command-line interpreter or command-line processor uses a command-line interface (CLI) to receive commands from a user in the form of lines of text.This provides a means of setting parameters for the environment, invoking executables and providing information to them as to what actions they are to perform. In some cases the invocation is conditional based on conditions established by the user or previous executables.*
* *Such access was first provided by computer terminals starting in the mid-1960s. This provided an interactive environment not available with punched cards or other input methods.*

### CLI common commands 
* *pwd* (present working directory) and hit enter; this shows file path for your current directory
* *ls* and hit enter; lists files in your current directory
* *cd folderName* and hit enter; changes directory to folderName
* *mkdir newFolderName* and hit enter; creates new directory
* *touch newFileName* and hit enter; creates new file

### CLI command resource
* There are many more CLI commands than listed above in 'CLI common commands' -- here is a solid [CLI cheat sheet](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/linux-command-line/) for Linux environments
