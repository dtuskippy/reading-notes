## Personal Background / Intro
### *Hi there!*  ✌️

* My name is Alan Chelko and I am originally from Western Pennsylvania -- currently though, I live in Prague Czech Republic, so I’ll be attending Code Fellows 9 time zones away
* I have a business background, having worked in venture capital or on the management side in startup environments, but have always been the guy with the MBA in the tech world without the tech background, and would like to change that dynamic
* So I am very interested in pivoting career-wise, and interested in having a skill set that would enable both a digital nomad career path, as well as the potential to be a technical founder of a startup
* I am a US Army veteran, so I am fortunate to tap into a Veterans program to help me out with Code Fellows
