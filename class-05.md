## Class-05 Reading Notes  
<p>It is clear that readings on HTML and CSS are relevant to the course on hand -- they're 2 of the 3 (along with JavaScript) building blocks of modern websites.</p>

### HTML Media 

1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
    * Screen readers can read the alt attribute and explain the image to its user
    * They're also helpful for various situations where an image is not rendered, and at least the user can understand what the image was about
2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
    * Alt text allows screen readers to 'read the image' and provide context to visually-impaired users
3. Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.
    * Provides a chance to create a self-contained unit on a web page where an image is clearly linked to a caption
4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
    * GIF better for photographs, and has ability for simple animation as well
    * Re. simple non-photographic images, SVG has better resolution and doesn't lose fidelity when zooming in
5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
    * Lossless WebP or PNG -- lossless is important, especically if there is text in the screenshot, since text becomes fuzzy and hard to read with lossy compression

### Learn CSS

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
    * Assume you see the image of a Classic Coke can -- the white text is the foreground, and red background is the background.
2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
    * Obvious moves would be adding a tasteful background keeping in fidelity with the nature of the blog, and sensible coloring of relevant text to stand out, e.g. the title of the blog could have different color than the body text.
3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
    * In short, browser compatibility -- you must be aware of web-safe fonts, and can use default fonts as backup via a font stack.
4. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?
    * They change their size (often via pixels), weight (e.g. bold), and style (e.g. italic).
5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.
    * Via letter and word spacing via pixel adjustments.


## Things I want to know more about
