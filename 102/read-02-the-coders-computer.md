## The Coder's Computer Reading Notes  
### Text Editor definition and tips

* Excerpts from [(article on choosing a text editor)](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf): 
  *   *A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.*
    + *Some of the most important features are:*
      1. *code completion*
      2. *syntax highlighting*
      3. *a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)*
      4. *the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them*



### CLI (Command Line Interface) defined -- [(CLI in Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
* *A command-line interpreter or command-line processor uses a command-line interface (CLI) to receive commands from a user in the form of lines of text.This provides a means of setting parameters for the environment, invoking executables and providing information to them as to what actions they are to perform. In some cases the invocation is conditional based on conditions established by the user or previous executables.*
* *Such access was first provided by computer terminals starting in the mid-1960s. This provided an interactive environment not available with punched cards or other input methods.*

### CLI common commands 
* *pwd* (present working directory) and hit enter; this shows file path for your current directory
* *ls* and hit enter; lists files in your current directory
* *cd folderName* and hit enter; changes directory to folderName
* *mkdir newFolderName* and hit enter; creates new directory
* *touch newFileName* and hit enter; creates new file

### CLI command resource
* There are many more CLI commands than listed above in 'CLI common commands' -- here is a solid [CLI cheat sheet](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/linux-command-line/) for Linux environments
