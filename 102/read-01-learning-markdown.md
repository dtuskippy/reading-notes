## Markdown Reading Notes  
### Markdown defined

* Excerpt from [(Wikipedia entry)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown): *Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.*

### Markdown examples
* Markdown has some pretty simple syntax, and is a bit reminiscent of html:
  - Headers preceded by number signs: Heading level 1 (largest) gets a single #, Heading level 2 goes with ##, ... Heading level 4 gets ####
  - Text wrapped by asterisks (*) become *italicized*
  - Ordered lists bullets are handled by adding numbers followed by periods in front of line items, e.g. 1. text, 2. text...
  - Unorderd lists go with -, *, or + in front of line items

### Markdown examples
* Markdown is best to learn with actual practice along with the help of great reference resources, such as the following:
  - From open source project, [*The Markdown Guide*](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists-1)
