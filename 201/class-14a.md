<p>This is yet another means to the ends of making a website more interesting, interactive, and engagement-enhancing.</p>

### CSS Transforms

1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?
    * Transform elements on 2D or 3D basis, e.g. rotating, distorting, etc.
2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.
    * Generally, I see this is as the ability to increase activity with various graphics, e.g. 3D rotate could be made to activate a company logo by user behavior, and subsequently trigger some other action like a newsletter signup form.

### CSS Transitions & Animations

1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
    * Alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.
2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?
    * Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

### 8 simple CSS3 transitions that will wow your users

1. What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?
    * Excite your users, increase engagement and ultimately, when used well, increase your conversions.
2. How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?
    * I would like to a technical founder, and have thoughts on both the B2B and B2C side -- what is obvious to me is how often B2B sites are quite *sterile* versus B2C sites...and they shouldn't be -- i.e. making intelligent use of the latest graphics capabilities would provide differentiation and could lead to real positive business outcomes.

## Things I want to know more about

1. I am most curious about best practices on how to use transitions and animations effectively, i.e. I think some intelligent usage adds needed spice, but over-use is like adding sugar to a bowl of Lucky Charms.
