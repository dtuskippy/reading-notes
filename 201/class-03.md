## Class-03 Reading Notes  
<p>It is pretty self-evident that readings on HTML, CSS and JavaScript have relevance to the course at hand -- they're the building blocks of modern websites.</p>

### Learn HTML - Ordered and Unordered Lists

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
    * When you have a list where the order is pretty much meaningless.
2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
    * Via the type attribute, e.g. circle, disc, square.
3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?
    * When the order is meaningful (top 10 list, step-by-step directions, etc.), use an odered list; otherwise, go with unordered.
4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
    * Via the reversed and start attributes; reversed literally reversed the order of the list, and start allows you start the list at any number you want (default is 1).
    * Additionally, via the type attribute, you have options for the type of 'number' used, e.g. numbers, roman numerals, letters.

### Learn CSS - The Box Model

1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
    * Margin - the guard outside the house
    * Padding - the guard inside the house
2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.
    * Margins - white space carved out on the page on the outside of the box
    * Borders - just as it says, the border of the box
    * Padding - white space carved out inside the box outside of the actual content
    * Content - the payload of the actual box, be it text, image, etc.

### Learn JS - Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?
    * Strings, numbers, objects, and other arrays; can also mix data types in a single array.
2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?
    * Yes
    * Can access via indexing
3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
    * Addition shorthand assignment	of x += f() for x = x + f()
    * Subtraction shorthand assignment of x -= f() for x = x - f()
    * Multiplication shorthand assignment of x *= f() for x = x * f()
    * Division shorthand assignment of x /= f()	for x = x / f()
    * Remainder shorthand assignment of x %= f() for x = x % f()
4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.
    * 10dog
    * First the addition in the parentheses is done, and 10 + 0 (unless a string involved, JS assumes both sides are numbers, and number assigned to false is 0) is 10, and 10 plus the string of 'dog' results in the conconcatenation of 10 and 'dog' into 10dog
5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
    * Obvious example is a function that takes in the result of a prompt to user, and then provides output conditional on user input
6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.
    * Simple example would be a prompt to user which asks for a number, and the loop runs some type of output by the amount of times per the number provided by the user


## Things I want to know more about
* Need a lot more experience working with CSS; seems like a topic that is hard to read about; have to just use it a lot
