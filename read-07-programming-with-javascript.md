## Programming with JavaScript

### Control Flow

* The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
* Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
* For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:

```
if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}
```
* Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.
  
### Functions

* A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
* A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
* A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
* Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
* The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas: (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
* The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

```
function product(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  return parameter1 * parameter2 * parameter3; // code to be executed
}

product(3, 2, 4); // product would return 24
```

### Operators

* You can combine and transform values with operators. 
* Binary operators include:
  * Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, and %), 
  * String concatenation (+), 
  * Comparison (==, !=, ===, !==, <, >, <=, >=), and 
  * Logic: and is '&&'; or is '||'
* Unary operators include:
  * '-' to negate a number,
  * ! to negate logically,  
  * typeof to find a valueâ€™s type, and
  * a ternary operator (?:) to pick one of two values based on a third value

### JavaScript online resource

* A great resource is a free online book titled [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/), and written by Marijn Haverbeke.
