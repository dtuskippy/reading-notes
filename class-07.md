## Class-07 Reading Notes  
<p>It is clear that readings on HTML and CSS are relevant to the course on hand -- they're 2 of the 3 (along with JavaScript) building blocks of modern websites.</p>

### Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
    * Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
    * A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders.
    * As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

### HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
    * Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users:  Because tables are not the right tool for layout, and the markup is more complex than with CSS layout techniques, the screenreaders' output will be confusing to their users.
    * Tables produce tag soup: table layouts generally involve more complex markup structures than proper layout techniques. This can result in the code being harder to write, maintain, and debug
    * Tables are not automatically responsive: tables are sized according to their content by default, so extra measures are needed to get table layout styling to effectively work across a variety of devices.
2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML < table >.
    * < table > tags that enclose the table.
    * < th > tags that enclose headers, setting out the columns.
    * < tr > tags that enclsoe rows.
    * < td > tags that enclose cells.

### Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
    * 
2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
    * 

### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question
