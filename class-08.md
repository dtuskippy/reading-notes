### Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
    * You can control alignment in one axis, a row or a column, not both together as in a grid
2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
    * The value (row or column) assigned to the flex-direction property determines the main axis, and then by default, the cross axis is the opposite of the main axis selection, e.g. if flex-direction: column, then the main axis is column and the cross axis is row
3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
    * Anything that changes the order of things in Flexbox versus the HTML layout can cause problems for the screen reader, e.g. usage of row-reverse and column-reverse should undergo thorough testing

### CSS Layout - Flexbox

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
    * The following can be come via flexbox, but not float:
        * Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
        * Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
        * Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.
2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
    * This gives me the tools necessary for responsive design, i.e. creating websites that are viewable across multiple browsers and devices.
