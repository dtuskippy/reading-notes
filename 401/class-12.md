# Class-12 Reading Notes

It's pretty self-evident that security is extremely relevant to the design, development and deployment of web apps.

## [Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

1. What is a Web Socket?
    * 
2. Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.
    * 
3. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.
    * 

## [Socket.io Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/)

1. What does the event handler io.on() do?
    * 
2. Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected.
    * 
3. What does socket.emit() do?If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?
    * 

## [Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

1. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).
    * 
2. When would you use Socket.IO?
    * 
3. When would you use WebSockets?
    *
