# Class-16 Reading Notes

It's a topic that is very relevant to this week's course work, but also very practical in the 'real world'.

## [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

1. What is an EC2 Instance?
    * An instance is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud. 
    * With Amazon EC2, you can set up and configure the operating system and applications that run on your instance. 
    * When you sign up for AWS, you can get started with Amazon EC2 using the AWS Free Tier .
2. Name 2 use cases for EC2.
    * Run cloud-native and enterprise applications
    * Scale for HPC applications
    * Develop for Apple platforms
    * Train and deploy ML applications
3. Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of Heroku.
    * Heroku can meet low computational demands, whereas AWS can meet high/very high computational demands.

## [EC2 For Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZMkgOMYYIg)

1. Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?
    * 
2. Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.
    * 
3. Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
    * 

## [Elastic Beanstalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwxAScdyT0)

1. What is Elastic Beanstalk?
    * AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an orchestration service offered by Amazon Web Services for deploying applications which orchestrates various AWS services, including EC2, S3, Simple Notification Service (SNS), CloudWatch, autoscaling, and Elastic Load Balancers.
2. Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.
    * Elastic beanstalk is one layer of abstraction away from EC2 -- effectively EC2 is the compute infrastructure (albeit virtual), an Elastic Beanstalk manages that compute infrastructure (not only EC2 but other software components and tools).
3. Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.
    * Elastic Beanstalk's main benefits include timesaving server configuration, powerful customization, and a cost-effective price point. 
    * Elastic Beanstalk automates the setup, configuration, and provisioning of other AWS services like EC2, RDS, and Elastic Load Balancing to create a web service.

## Things I want to know more about

1. I would like to dig in deeper on some of the documentation for Socket.io.
