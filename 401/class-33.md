# Class-33 -- Login and Auth

This is a new wrinkle on a topic covered in earlier parts of the course. 

## [What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-role-based-access-control-rbac-examples-benefits-and-more)

1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?
    * Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. 
    * The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network
2. Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.
    * Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
    * Management role group – you can add and remove members.
    * Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
    * Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.
3. What are the Benefits of RBAC?
    * Reducing administrative work and IT support.
    * Maximizing operational efficiency.
    * Improving compliance.

## Compare and Contrast the following two Libraries and the following questions. Yes, they are similarly named.

* [react-cookie library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie)
* [react-cookies component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookies)

1. Describe some react-cookie features.
    * Not clear re. features, but appears to give various functionality around cookies such as 'set', 'remove', and 'get'.
2. Describe some react-cookies features.
    * No information re. features.
3. Which library would you prefer would you prefer? Why?
    * Can not say with available information -- would have to investigate further.

## Reflection

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
    * Try to gain something useful about login and auth.

## Things I want to know more about

1. I know we'll learn about Redux soon, so quite curious about how to decide on when to use Context with hooks versus Redux, etc.
