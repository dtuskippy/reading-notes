# Class-38 -- Redux - Asynchronous Actions

This is the topic of the week, and a pretty hot topic in React land.

## [async actions](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-6-async-logic)

1. Why use Redux middleware?
2. Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.
3. How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?

## [thunk middleware](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)

1. Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?
2. Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.
3. Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.

## Things I want to know more about

1. Redux is a complex topic I have barely scratched the surface of, so plenty more to dig into.
