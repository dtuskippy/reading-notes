# Class-34 -- API Integration

This is the topic of the week, and a pretty hot topic in React land.

## Review API Server Build

1. Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter.
2. What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:
    1. Domain: http://our-site.com
    2. v3
    3. model name: stuff
    4. id: things
3. We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.

## Review Auth Server Build

1. Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.
2. Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth.
3. Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend.

## Reflection

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

## Things I want to know more about

1. I know we'll learn about Redux soon, so quite curious about how to decide on when to use Context with hooks versus Redux, etc.
