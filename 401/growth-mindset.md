# 401 Prep - Growth Mindset

## Growth Mindset

1. From Aerosmith's 'Dream On': *You got to lose to know how to win*.
2. I have worked for years in the startup / venture capital world where failure is embraced as part of the process, and the only real shame is never trying something to begin with, i.e. the growth mindset describes a culture I am already very much a part of.

## Emotional Intelligence

1. There may be some use to such an exercise, but obviously most relevant data would need to be collected from others who interact with the subject.
2. From my experience, in competitive business environments, I am much better with EI in dealing with the other team / external parties; much more complicated in dealing with 'own team', where collaboration / competition dynamic is often a gray blur, and leads to fundamental trust issues.
3. Further to point #2, I think all of these differ across all sort of relationships, from a variety of dynamics in professional landscape (per #2), to personal (spouse, siblings, parents, children, adult friends and acquaintances, 'old neighborhood friends', etc.)
4. It is practically impossible to improve in such areas in life, unless you get honest feedback from somebody you truly respect and trust -- and honest feedback from somebody you truly trust and respect is a rare event.

## Bias Assessment

1. I have mainly worked as an American abroad, so there are myriad biases out there in the world across cross cultural teams, incl. Americans of many different stripes.
2. The only success I have seen is grounded in simple guidelines:
    * Let people be judged by their character, efforts and results.
    * Treat people as you would want to be treated.
    * And make efforts to meet with different types of people on a 1:1 basis as much as possible -- best if after work -- seeing the real world through their eyes is often pretty enlightening.
