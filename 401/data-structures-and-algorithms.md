## SQL Practice


### SQL Summary

* Recursion is when a function calls itself, and is used to make a function more clear (i.e. easier to understand), despite often times providing no performance benefits.
* Recursion is split into 2 cases to avoid the possibility of spiraling into an infinite loop:
    * Base Case: When the function doesn't call itself again, so it doesn't go into an infinite loop.
    * Recursive Case: When the function calls itself.
* When a recursive spirals into an infinite loop, control+C will kill it.
