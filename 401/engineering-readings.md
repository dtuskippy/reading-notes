## Class-01 Reading Notes
<p>The readings are a welcome primer on getting into the mindset of a) finding a paying job, and b) how to succeed once you're on the job.</p>

### Discussion Questions

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
    * I have a business background, having worked in venture capital or on the management side in startup environments for over 20 years, and most of that outside of the US (currently living in Prague) -- I think my background is quite unique for a budding developer and will bring value as I have the potential to bring strong client advocacy skills to the table
2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
    * Debug: Go step by step through the code trying to find out what is wrong.
    * Reassess: Take a step back, walk away from the code for a bit, and look at the problem from another perspective -- a more extreme version is simply to delete everything and start again with *fresh eyes*.
    * Research: Basically, start googling to find the answer in a range of online sources.  


### Things I want to know more about

1. I really need to understand the answer to the first discussion question above -- this is all for naught if I don't bring a unique proposition to the market.
