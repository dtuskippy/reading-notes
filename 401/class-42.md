# Class-42 -- Ethics

## Ethics in the workplace

[Microsoft and the DoD](https://web.archive.org/web/20200616232735/https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-employees-protest-contract-us-army-hololens-2019-2)

* I remember this story in the news, and doing an eye-roll at the time.
* Employee perspective from high level: I come from a union family growing up, so I think it's great to have employees speak up and have their voices heard.
* Management perspective:
  * In the tech industry specifically, management has to be extremely sensitive to tech talent, which can walk out the door at any time, i.e. even in cases where management thinks it's right on a position that employees are countering, management may have to back down due to the market-driven talent power imbalance, i.e. employees more in a power position than the company.
  * In this case, it seems clear that management thought it was dealing with a vocal minority of employees and stood it's ground.
* The issue itself -- 'war profiteering':
  * One person's 'war profiteering' is another person's 'patriotic vendor' (would you rather the Pentagon buys from the Chinese?)
  * I am not a pacifist -- I think it's self-evident that countries need strong militaries to protect their citizenry -- I would be a proud employee if my company was helping equip Ukraine currently, e.g.
  * Also, where do 'war profiteering' protests end?  I still remember the Burger King at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan -- do those same Microsoft employees boycott Burger King, or other 'food vendors' to the US Military, like ConAgra, General Mills, Hershey, Hormel, Mars, Nabisco, Reynolds, Smithfield, Swift and Tyson? They would seem to claim that food and weapons are in different categories, but...why?  How is war profiteering any different for weapons producers than for food vendors, or medical supply companies?  Is the producer of medical bandages for wounded troops also evil because they make profits from war?  The slippery slope is really quite slippery.
  * Important to note, this is not a case where Microsoft is secretly selling chemical weapons (i.e. which is illegal) to Russia or Syria, it's a legal contract with the US Military in the wide open.

## Ethics in Technology

* These articles are really out-of-date, so I selected something more up-to-date on a related theme.

[Surveillance Capitalism](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy)

* Shoshana Zuboff is a Harvard Professor considered the preeminent thought leader on big tech's privacy abuses -- this article discusses her well-known and much-discussed book, *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power.*
* *It describes how global tech companies such as Google and Facebook persuaded us to give up our privacy for the sake of convenience; how personal information (“data”) gathered by these companies has been used by others not only to predict our behaviour but also to influence and modify it; and how this has had disastrous consequences for democracy and freedom. This is the “surveillance capitalism” of the title, which Zuboff defines as a “new economic order” and “an expropriation of critical human rights that is best understood as a coup from above”.*
* This is really the topic of the day, and arguably rightly conflated (IMHO) with mis/disinformation issues in the tech world in which social media companies steal the headlines appropriately (try not reading about Elon Musk and Twitter, and a current Republican call (led by [Marc Rubio](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/10/marco-rubio-ban-tiktok-america-china-mike-gallagher/)) to ban Tik Tok for national security reasons).
  * But of course, almost any company of note in practically every industry on planet earth is evangelising about the use of data (not only customer data, to be sure) actualizing on it, and inevitably that lends itself to mining customer data in myriad questionable ways.
* This whole phenomenom is so new that it is often hard to winnow out naive blunders from nefarious pre-medidated acts, but it seems clear that this is both a real threat to society in general, and also a huge opportunity for those who wish to solve it -- among the 'problem solvers' there seems to be a bit of a foot race between:
  * [Tech entrepreneurs](https://wirewheel.io/blog/vc-investments-privacy-tech-spokes/) attempting to find 'white hat' solutions without the need for state intervention, and
  * Political entrepreneurs attempting to solve the issue via state intervention (witness the aforementioned Rubio, or [Margrethe Vestager in Europe](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132809675/elon-musk-twitter-eu-margrethe-vestager))
* Personally, I have been getting involved in this space, and will be attending a conference next week addressing the fight against mis/disinformation in Eastern Europe, with an emphasis on recent events in Ukraine.
