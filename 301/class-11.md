## Class-11 Reading Notes  
<p>I have some familiarity with the differences between sql and no sql from my business background, but look forward to digging deeper.</p>

### nosql vs sql

![NoSQL vs SQL Table](images/sql_nosql_table.png)

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    * SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and tables with logical links between them) -- very good with transactional data.
2. Give a real world example.
    * Classic 'old school' business data like financial transactions / accounting.
3. What kind of data is a good fit for  a NoSQL database?
    * NoSQL databases are often better suited to storing and modeling structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.


## Things I want to know more about

1. I look forward to digging into Mongo -- a company I know of locally that I have a chance to do an initial apprenticeship with has a CMS product based on Mongo.
