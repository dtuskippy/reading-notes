## Class-5 Reading Notes  
<p>The React Docs topic seems super relevant and deals with the subjectivity required to actually architect (for lack of a better term) a React app, where hard decisions are required about fuzzy situations about when to make break out a component into sub-components and where to store state.

## Things I want to know more about

1. Specific to 'Thinking in React', I am curious about how often significant changes occur to React architecture in the real world, especially for a fast growing company, which may not only be adding whole new product categories with different requirements, but even a new business model, where, e.g. a product company moves to subscription -- basically, I'm curious how 'disruptive' the disruptive company is to itself in terms of web app architecture.
