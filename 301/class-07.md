### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

1. If you took Code 201, skim this article again for a refresher. If you did not take Code 201, read this article and think about how it can influence the way you work with your partners during pair programming.

* My Summary
    * The article details Project Aristotle, a research project launched at Google to study team performance, an attempt to isolate the key variables on why certain teams perform better than others
    * The team's results were paradoxical, although the author didn't appear to pick up on that seemingly highly relevant fact.
    * The team initially discovered 'the who' didn't matter in terms of team performance, but rather a team's norms were the key factor to success, specifically around *psychological safety*, basically a group environment where one can 'just be yourself'.
    * But then the research pointed to the fact that the teams that performed well, i.e. that had greater psychological safety (effectively superior norms), were based on the fact that the team members themselves scored above average on the *Reading the Mind in the Eyes* test (a test that measures ‘average social sensitivity’, i.e. being skilled at intuiting how others feel based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues) -- so 'the who' does in fact matter a LOT.

* My Take
    * I have an MBA and so have lived through myriad management books and fads and gurus -- I always go back to the teachings of a business school professor I had who had been responsible for implementing teams in Chrysler's manufacturing process:
    * He took teams very seriously, and thought there were very few organizations, outside of the military, that took building a culture around team very seriously -- re. military, in the Marines, officers always eat last after their enlisted Marines go first -- that is real culture-building.
    * His other great maxim that he applied generally to all manner of paradigm shifts in management thinking -- "you can't get away from the fact that it almost always *just depends*"
    * My point is that for a company to truly go beyond the randomized factor of individual teams depending on 'the who', the company itself has to have a culture of a successful team, and that is VERY hard to do, and has to come from complete, ongoing and total buy-in at the top.
    * As ex-military and having worked in big tech firm in the Valley, I was amazed at how bad the basic management skills like 'lead by example' were -- I only ever encountered a culture built upon lies and politics -- good luck building teams in such an environment -- the official teams I was on there were 'air quote teams' -- but on an ad hoc basis, people did find a way to cooperate to get jobs done when their careers were at stake, i.e. heavily incentive-driven.

### How I explained REST to my brother
1. Who is Roy Fielding?
    * Roy Thomas Fielding (born 1965) is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project -- [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding).
2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
    * Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
    * The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser -- [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol).  Per the reading, HTTP is a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.
4. What does a GET do?
    * GET is an HTTP method for requesting data from the server, e.g. when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and comes back with a web page.
5. What does a POST do?
    * The HTTP POST method sends data to the server, i.e. ADDS to the server.
6. What does PUT do?
    * The HTTP PUT request method creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload, i.e. REPLACES something on the server.
7. What does PATCH do?
    * HTTP PATCH request is used to do a partial update on a server.

### API Keys
Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.

#### Geocoding API

1. Did you get your API key?
    * YES.

#### Weather Bit API

1. Did you get your API key?
    * YES.

#### Yelp API Docs

1. Did you get your API key?
    * YES.

#### The Movie DB API Docs

1. Did you get your API key?
    * YES.

### Things I want to know more about

1. I am very interested in actually working with APIs -- I'm not a newbie to the concept, but a newbie in terms of actual implementation.
