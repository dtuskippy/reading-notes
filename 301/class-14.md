## Class-14 Reading Notes
<p>This is relevant to me personally from a slightly different angle -- I'm based in Europe, and the percentage of women who are startup founders or venture capitalists is incredibly small.</p>

### Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
    * Roughly in the mid-80s, the share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.
    * PCs were marketed as toys for video games primarily to boys / males, and parents were more likely to buy PCs for boys than for girls, resulting in a slant to the PC world being dominated by males.
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
    * Because males grew up with PCs, they became much more tech savvy than their female counterparts, resulting in male-dominated computer science classes / programs; teachers / professors adjusted their entry-level course curriculum / expectations in turn to a more advanced level, and females entering '101'-level courses were left behind, so to speak, at the outset -- i.e. a negative feedback loop had developed.

### Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies / Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
    * Where there is buy-in at the top.
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
    * The simple idea that a company with a workforce that is more representative of the market at large will be more in touch with its customer base, and more responsive, and lead to more relevant innovation.
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
    * When YouTubeâ€™s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.

## Things I want to know more about

1. I am curious about the topic from a startup perspective -- female founders are extremely rare in Europe where I'm based, and it is sometimes striking when you see that different market view brought to the table -- there is clearly an untapped market opportunity out there.
