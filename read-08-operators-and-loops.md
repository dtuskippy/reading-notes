## Operators and Loops

### Operators 

* The most common and fundamental **assignment operator** is equal (=); an assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. 
  * E.g. x = "cats" assigns the value of the string, "cats", to the variable of x
* **Comparison operators** compare its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. 
  * Equal (==): Returns true if the operands are equal.
  * Not equal (!=): Returns true if the operands are not equal.
  * Strict equal (===): Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. 
  * Strict not equal (!==): Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.	
  * Greater than (>): Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.	
  * Greater than or equal (>=): Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.	
  * Less than (<): Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.
  * Less than or equal (<=): Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

### Loops

* Whereas HTML is used to create the structure and actual content of a web page (such as written text), and CSS is responsible for the design or style of the website, JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements and allows for the development of interactive websites.
* JavaScript is single threaded. This is the reason lots of people who use multi-threaded programming thinks its working is slow as it would not be able to make use of all the cores of the CPU properly.
* Despite the fact that there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, respective standard libraries and syntax, these two languages are distinct and differ significantly in design.
* Like all other scripting languages, arrays and objects can be created with a brief shortcut syntax. These literals structure the basis of JSON data format.
* JavaScript supports regular expressions in a manner similar to Perl, which provides a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.

### JavaScript online resource

* Among many, probably the most respected practial online resource for developers is found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) on the MDN (Mozilla Developers Network) website.
